# Upgrade from v9.x to v10.x

Please consult the `examples` directory for reference example configurations. If you find a bug, please open an issue with supporting configuration to reproduce.

## List of backwards incompatible changes

- Terraform `v1.5.7` is now minimum supported version
- AWS provider `v6.5` is now minimum supported version

## Additional changes

### Added

- Support for `region` parameter to specify the AWS region for the resources created if different from the provider region.

### Modified

- Variable definitions now contain detailed `object` types in place of the previously used `any` type.
- Security group rules now use a default naming scheme of `<security-group-name>-<map-key>` unless a more specific rule name is provided.
- `rule.actions.type` has been replaced with `rule.actions.<type>`. See before/after below for more details.
- `query_string` supports a list of key:value pairs; type definition updated to support this (i.e. was `map(string)` and is now `list(map(string))`)
