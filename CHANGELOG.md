## [1.0.2] - 2017-10-12
### Added
* moved data sources to dedicated `data.tf` file.
* `aws_caller_identity` now used to gather account_id rather than using a variable.
* tests added for `target_group` and expanded for `alb`.
* input variables added for health checks, bucket policy, force_destroy_log_bucket - increasing flexibility.
* circle CI config and badge

### Changed
* altered structure of module to conform to the new [Terraform registry standards](https://www.terraform.io/docs/registry/modules/publish.html#requirements)
* `principle_account_id` (sp) moved to a data source rather than variable map. Spelling corrected.
* removed redundant `/test/alb` directory which had module contents copied. Test kitchen now uses the module itself.
* pinned examples to provider and terraform versions to harden versioning.
* self signed cert added to the test fixtures, eliminating the need for manual upload and terraform.tfvars configuration.
* modules referenced in the test fixture are now sourced from the terraform registry.
* moved bucket_policy.json and template rending to locals + optional variable input. 
* stringed list variables moved to native lists
