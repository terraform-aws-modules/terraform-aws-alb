# terraform-aws-alb

A Terraform module containing common configurations for an AWS Application Load
Balancer (ALB) running over HTTP/HTTPS. Available through the [Terraform registry](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/terraform-aws-modules/alb/aws).

## Assumptions

* You want to create a set of resources around an application load balancer: namely associated target groups and listeners.
* You've created a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) and subnets where you intend to put this ALB.
* You have one or more security groups to attach to the ALB.
* Additionally, if you plan to use an HTTPS listener, the ARN of an SSL certificate is required.

The module supports both (mutually exclusive):

* Internal ALBs
* External ALBs

It's recommended you use this module with [terraform-aws-vpc](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/terraform-aws-modules/vpc/aws),
[terraform-aws-security-group](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/terraform-aws-modules/security-group/aws), and
[terraform-aws-autoscaling](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/terraform-aws-modules/autoscaling/aws/).

Note:

It's strongly recommended that the autoscaling module is instantiated in the same
state as the ALB module as in flight changes to active target groups need to be propagated
to the ASG immediately or will result in failure. The value of `target_group[n][name]` also must change any time there are modifications to existing `target_groups`.

## Why ALB instead of ELB

ALB has the ability to replace what several ELBs can do by routing based on URI matchers.
Additionally, operating at layer 7 opens the ability to shape traffic using WAF.
[AWS's documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/applicationloadbalancer/) has a more
exhaustive set of reasons. Alternatively, if using ALB with ECS look no further than
the [HashiCorp example](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-aws/blob/master/examples/ecs-alb).

## Usage example

A full example leveraging other community modules is contained in the [examples/alb_test_fixture directory](https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-alb/tree/master/examples/alb_test_fixture). Here's the gist of using it via the Terraform registry:

```hcl
module "alb" {
  source  = "terraform-aws-modules/alb/aws"
  version = "~> 4.0"

  load_balancer_name            = "my-alb"
  security_groups               = ["sg-edcd9784", "sg-edcd9785"]
  log_bucket_name               = "logs-us-east-2-123456789012"
  log_location_prefix           = "my-alb-logs"
  subnets                       = ["subnet-abcde012", "subnet-bcde012a"]
  tags                          = "${map("Environment", "test")}"
  vpc_id                        = "vpc-abcde012"
  https_listeners               = "${list(map("certificate_arn", "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:server-certificate/test_cert-123456789012", "port", 443))}"
  https_listeners_count         = "1"
  http_tcp_listeners            = "${list(map("port", "80", "protocol", "HTTP"))}"
  http_tcp_listeners_count      = "1"
  target_groups                 = "${list(map("name", "foo", "backend_protocol", "HTTP", "backend_port", "80"))}"
  target_groups_count           = "1"
}
```

## Conditional creation

 Sometimes you need to have a way to create ALB resources conditionally but Terraform does not allow to use `count` inside `module` block, so the solution is to specify argument `create_alb`.

 ```hcl
# This ALB will not be created
module "alb" {
  source = "terraform-aws-modules/alb/aws"

  create_alb = false
  # ... omitted
}
```

## Testing

This module has been packaged with [awspec](https://github.com/k1LoW/awspec) tests through [kitchen](https://kitchen.ci/) and [kitchen-terraform](https://newcontext-oss.github.io/kitchen-terraform/). To run them:

1. Install [rvm](https://rvm.io/rvm/install) and the ruby version specified in the [Gemfile](https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-alb/tree/master/Gemfile).
2. Install bundler and the gems from our Gemfile:

    ```bash
    gem install bundler && bundle install
    ```

3. Ensure your AWS environment is configured (i.e. credentials and region) for test and set TF_VAR_region to a valid AWS region (e.g. `export TF_VAR_region=${AWS_REGION}`).
4. Test using `bundle exec kitchen test` from the root of the repo.

## Doc generation

Documentation should be modified within `main.tf` and generated using [terraform-docs](https://github.com/segmentio/terraform-docs).
Generate them like so:

```bash
terraform-docs md ./ | cat -s | sed '${/^$/d;}' > README.md
```
